I am working as an AI Resident at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence), where I have had a wonderful time working closely with [Prof. Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/), [Dr. Dat Quoc Nguyen](https://datquocnguyen.github.io/), [Dr. Tung Pham](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Tung_Pham1), together with many other harworking and dilligent colleagues. Towards developing AI systems that are more intuitive, responsible, and closely aligned with human cognition, I am working on reasoning and model interpretability techniques in NLP.
