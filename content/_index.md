I am working as an AI Resident at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence), where I have had a wonderful time working closely with [Prof. Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/), [Dr. Dat Quoc Nguyen](https://datquocnguyen.github.io/), [Dr. Tung Pham](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Tung_Pham1), together with many other harworking and dilligent colleagues. Towards developing AI systems that are more intuitive, responsible, and closely aligned with human cognition, I am working on reasoning and model interpretability techniques in NLP.

**ClozeMath: Improving Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models by Learning to Fill Equations**  
<u>*Quang Hieu Pham**</u>, Thuy Duong Nguyen*, Tung Pham, Anh Tuan Luu, Dat Quoc Nguyen                           
*Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2025*.
* We fine-tune LLMs with language modeling and text infilling objectives, focusing specifically on learning to fill equations, and the outcome is really good xD. 
* [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03763) [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03763) [[Code]]() 


**Whoâ€™s Who: Large Language Models Meet Knowledge Conflicts in Practice**.    
<u>*Quang Hieu Pham**</u>, Hoang Ngo*, Anh Tuan Luu, Dat Quoc Nguyen.   
*Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2024*.
* It's not just fake news; inherent ambiguities can also substantially deceive LLMs.
